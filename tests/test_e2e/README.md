# End-to-End Testing for Text-to-SQL Functionality

This directory contains comprehensive end-to-end tests for the KAI text-to-SQL system using real databases with synthetic data.

## Test Files Overview

### 1. `test_sql_execution_e2e.py` âœ… 
**Primary E2E Test Suite**

This is the main end-to-end test suite that validates SQL execution against realistic synthetic data.

**Features Tested:**
- **Database Schema Creation**: Comprehensive business analytics schema with 6 related tables
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: 18 employees across 5 companies with realistic relationships
- **Business Intelligence Queries**: 7 complex analytical queries covering:
  - Employee analytics by department
  - Project budget vs actual cost analysis
  - Performance analytics and ratings
  - Time tracking and utilization
  - Company revenue analysis
  - Salary distribution analysis
  - Project timeline analysis
- **Complex Join Operations**: Multi-table queries with aggregations and window functions
- **Data Integrity Validation**: Foreign key relationship verification
- **Performance Testing**: Query execution time benchmarks
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Safe query parameter handling
- **Text-to-SQL Simulation**: Natural language to SQL conversion scenarios

**Key Test Scenarios:**
```python
# Example business intelligence query
"What is the total revenue and average order value for each product category?"
â†’ Complex aggregation with joins across products, order_items, and orders

# Example employee analytics
"Show me all employees in the Engineering department" 
â†’ Simple filtering with department-based grouping

# Example performance analysis
"Which projects are over budget?"
â†’ Budget vs actual cost comparison with percentage calculations
```

### 2. `test_text_to_sql_mysql_e2e.py` ðŸš§
**MySQL-Specific Test Suite** 

Focused on MySQL dialect compatibility and syntax validation.

**Features:**
- MySQL-compatible schema and syntax
- E-commerce domain synthetic data
- MySQL-specific SQL generation patterns
- Mock-based service layer testing

**Status**: Partial implementation (mocking challenges with service layer)

### 3. `test_text_to_sql_e2e.py` ðŸš§
**Original SQLite Test Suite**

Initial implementation focusing on SQLite compatibility.

**Status**: Deprecated in favor of more comprehensive SQL execution tests

## Synthetic Data Design

### Database Schema
The test database simulates a realistic business analytics environment:

```sql
-- Core business entities
companies (5 records) â†’ Multi-industry representation
employees (18 records) â†’ Hierarchical structure with managers
projects (6 records) â†’ Various statuses and budget scenarios
project_assignments â†’ Many-to-many employee-project relationships
time_logs â†’ Daily time tracking data
performance_reviews â†’ Quarterly review cycles
```

### Data Characteristics
- **Referential Integrity**: All foreign keys properly maintained
- **Business Logic**: Realistic salary ranges, project budgets, performance ratings
- **Temporal Data**: Date ranges spanning multiple quarters
- **Hierarchical Relationships**: Manager-employee reporting structure
- **Performance Scenarios**: Mix of over/under budget projects, various employee ratings

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all end-to-end tests
uv run pytest tests/test_e2e/ -v

# Run specific test suite
uv run pytest tests/test_e2e/test_sql_execution_e2e.py -v

# Run with detailed output
uv run pytest tests/test_e2e/test_sql_execution_e2e.py -v -s
```

## Test Coverage

### âœ… Completed Test Areas
1. **Database Creation & Schema Validation**
2. **Business Intelligence Query Execution**
3. **Complex Multi-Table Joins**
4. **Data Integrity & Referential Constraints**
5. **Query Performance Benchmarking**
6. **SQL Injection Prevention**
7. **Text-to-SQL Workflow Simulation**

### ðŸ”„ Areas for Enhancement
1. **Service Layer Integration**: Complete mocking of SQLGenerationService
2. **Real Database Connections**: Test against actual MySQL/PostgreSQL instances
3. **LLM Integration Testing**: End-to-end workflow with actual language models
4. **Error Handling Scenarios**: Invalid SQL generation and recovery
5. **Concurrency Testing**: Multiple simultaneous query execution
6. **Large Dataset Performance**: Scalability testing with larger synthetic datasets

## Key Testing Principles

### Realistic Synthetic Data
- **Business Context**: E-commerce and corporate analytics scenarios
- **Data Volume**: Representative of small-to-medium business scale
- **Relationships**: Complex many-to-many and hierarchical structures
- **Temporal Patterns**: Historical data with recent activity focus

### Query Complexity Progression
1. **Simple Filters**: Single table, basic WHERE clauses
2. **Aggregations**: GROUP BY with COUNT, SUM, AVG functions
3. **Joins**: INNER/LEFT JOIN operations across related tables
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Window functions, CASE statements, subqueries
5. **Business Intelligence**: Complex reporting queries with multiple metrics

### Validation Strategy
- **Structural Validation**: Verify query execution without errors
- **Business Logic Validation**: Ensure results make logical sense
- **Performance Validation**: Queries complete within acceptable timeframes
- **Data Consistency**: Referential integrity maintained across operations

## Integration with KAI System

These tests validate the core SQL execution capabilities that support:
- **Natural Language Processing**: Query understanding and intent extraction
- **SQL Generation**: Conversion from natural language to executable SQL
- **Database Integration**: Connection and query execution across different databases
- **Result Processing**: Data formatting and response generation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure and recovery mechanisms

## Future Enhancements

1. **Multi-Database Testing**: Parallel testing across PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite
2. **Schema Evolution**: Tests for dynamic schema changes and migrations
3. **Real-Time Data**: Streaming data scenarios and real-time analytics
4. **User Permissions**: Role-based access control and data security
5. **API Integration**: Full REST API testing with database interactions
6. **Performance Profiling**: Detailed query optimization and bottleneck identification
